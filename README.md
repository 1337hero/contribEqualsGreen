# Making GitHub Green
This is a simple, and fun little shell script. I wanted to learn some bash commands and this just adds whitespace, then deletes white space to this README. Then it pushes to this Repo. Recently I decided to expand it on the idea of using Node to run bash scripts. It's a very basic experiment.

To run the script:
```
bun run stat
```

Thatâ€™s all there is to it. =)
